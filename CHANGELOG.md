# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Hint** button. Two taps, not one: the first says which cell is about to
  give, the second acts on it -- a player who is told where to look usually
  finds the rest themselves, and only pays for the full reveal if they want
  it. A cell that contradicts the solution is always reported before a fresh
  one is revealed, and on a mistake the hint empties the cell rather than
  solving it.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Generated puzzles had no uniqueness verification — clues were
  revealed as a random fraction of the solved path with no check that
  the remaining givens still pinned down a single orthogonally-
  connected 1..n*n path, so some puzzles admitted more than one valid
  solution even though only one was recognized as correct. Generation
  now digs clues one at a time and keeps a cell hidden only after
  proving with a bounded backtracking search that exactly one solution
  remains, guaranteeing every puzzle has a unique solution.
